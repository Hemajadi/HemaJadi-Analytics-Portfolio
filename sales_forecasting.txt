Sales Forecasting Report

1. Introduction
Sales forecasting is a critical aspect of business planning that helps companies predict future revenue and make informed decisions. This report focuses on analyzing past sales data and forecasting future sales using the ARIMA model.

2. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- The dataset consists of historical sales data with two key columns: Date and Sales.
- Data is cleaned, missing values handled, and converted into a time series format for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis
- A time-series plot is used to visualize sales trends.
- Seasonal variations and long-term trends are identified.

4. Sales Forecasting Using ARIMA Model
- The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is implemented.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
- Model parameters (p, d, q) are selected based on ACF and PACF plots.
- Model is trained and tested to ensure accuracy.

5. Forecast Results
- The next 30 days of sales are predicted using the trained ARIMA model.
- The forecast is visualized in comparison with actual sales data.

6. Conclusion
Sales forecasting using ARIMA provides a robust mechanism to predict future trends, helping businesses make strategic decisions regarding inventory, pricing, and marketing efforts.

7. Future Enhancements
- Using deep learning techniques such as LSTM for improved accuracy.
- Incorporating external factors like promotions, holidays, and economic conditions to refine predictions.
